# WebScrape
A browser extension based web-scraper.


**This is an experimental project! Use at your own risk**

Still thinking of a way for all relevant fields to be inputted in one file. This project is still under heavy construction.

Not intended to be released as a real extension, more of a dev-tool for easy and simple webscraping using Chrome.


## Usage
Edit the `config.json`
Edit the `scrape()` function in the `index.js` file.


## Uses
- Used this to scrape image links and metadata on mtgpics for backgrounds.
